          <p>I have been a web developer for the past 13 years. I enjoy what I do, and so on occasion I like to create new designs and offer them for free to the public. When I got started many years ago, I always found that looking at other designers work was one of the best ways to learn proper development. So this is my way of giving back. Creating all these templates does take a significant amount of time however, any donation (however small) is always very much appreciated.
